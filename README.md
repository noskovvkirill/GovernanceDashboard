### Proposal

✺ The idea is to create a semi-spatial interface for the protocol proposals to reduce a cognitive load from homogeneous text, identical pages, and proposals. Each protocol has to have a unique and identifiable page, color palette, etc while preserving project integrity.

✺ Humans remember things spatially (see Mind Palace). Websites are no different from architecture and the cities — every page has to have a unique character as a room or a building.

✺ Decentralized projects often rely on UI/UX patterns developed for web-2. We have to explore the patterns for a new web where wallets & governance mechanisms are part of every website.

✺ The project is not trying to be a safe solution and to-go place for everyone but tries to find new methods to analyze the protocols.
